This program took me 0:10:19 to complete in C (a language that I'm only decent at)

It takes in a single number N first specifying how many entries will be in the data set 
the following N lines are the data set to compute the mean and standard deviation for

the program is 34 lines long and I got the correct answer after 4 compile edit cycles
